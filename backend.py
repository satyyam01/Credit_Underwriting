                    Thank you for submitting your loan application. Based on the information provided, here are some general recommendations:

                    ## Key Factors to Consider

                    - **Your credit score** is one of the most important factors in loan approval
                    - **Debt-to-income ratio** significantly impacts your borrowing capacity
                    - **Loan purpose** can affect risk assessment and interest rates
                    - **Employment history** demonstrates stability to lenders

                    ## Recommendations

                    1. Consider paying down existing debt before applying
                    2. Check your credit report for errors that might be affecting your score
                    3. Maintain consistent employment history
                    4. Save for a larger down payment if possible

4. PRACTICAL: Provide specific, actionable advice that can be implemented, not vague suggestions.

5. EMPATHETIC: Acknowledge that loan applications can be stressful and maintain a supportive tone.
